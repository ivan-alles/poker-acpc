This is Kevin Waugh's Open Source CFR for the LEDUC card game.
There are 3 programs included in the implementation:

train - Trains a strategy based on an abstraction.  Some sample abstractions
are included in the abstractions directory. The player can be trained with the
same abstraction in both seats or with 2 different abtractions.

play - play 2 strategies against one another.

best_response - create a best response to a particular strategy.  The output is
the best response strategy which can also be inside of a specified abstraction.

Information on CFR, LEDUC, ABSTRACTION and BEST RESPONSE can all be found at
the U of A's poker group page http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/poker in the 
publications section.
