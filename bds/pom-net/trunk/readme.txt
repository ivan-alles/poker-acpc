This package contains a parent pom for BDS .NET projects.
The pom itself is in the src directory. The pom.xml in the root 
is the installer. The versions in both poms must be the same. At the moment
I don't know any better way to make it working.

After updating of the parent pom it may be neccessary to update package-net
package (a maven template for BDS .NET projects).
