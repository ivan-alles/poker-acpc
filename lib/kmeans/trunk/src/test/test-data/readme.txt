Performs a similar validation as in the original kml. I compared the results made
on windowns as good as possible, but it hardly possible to verify everything due to 
the random nature of the algorithms. I saved the results made on windows machine for
reference.

Run run-tests.bat to run all tests and compare the results with the reference results.

Run update.bat to copy the current results to the reference results.
