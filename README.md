# Poker bots for the [Annual Computer Poker Competition](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org)

The bots play fixed limit holdem heads up poker.

* Neytiri is a counter-bot for [Fell Omen 2](http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/index.php?n=Main.ArtificialIntelligencePoker), which was ranked 2nd in the 2008 competition.

* Patience is a fixed equilibrium strategy bot. In the 2012 competition Patience tied 4th with the team of the University of Alberta. This is the strongest team in the field, having many times more manpower and computing resources at their disposal. A couple of smart heuristics used by Patience allowed it to score equal to its powerful competitor.

The project is ported from an SVN repository as is. The code can be made running with older Visual Studio versions.
