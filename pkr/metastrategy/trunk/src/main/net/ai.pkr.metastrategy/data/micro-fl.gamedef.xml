<!--
This is a simple heads-up fixed limit game (dimension: 49) with a non-trivial strategy.

It models the following properties of real poker:

- Multiple rounds (2).
- Private and shared cards.
- Strength of a pocket can be changed significantly by the board (worse cards turns to nuts).

The cards are like in Kuhn poker: J, Q, K with ranks respectively from 1 to 3, but there are 2 Jacks.

There are two rounds, in each of them there is a raise limit of one. 

In the round 0 one private card is dealt. In the round 1 one shared card is dealt.

Hand strength is defined according to the following rules:

- If board is J and pocket is J, the rank of the hand is 4 (absolute maximum).
- Otherwise the rank of the hand equals the rank of the pocket.
- The hand with the highest rank wins the showdown.
