<!--
This is a simple heads-up fixed limit game (dimension: 85, 81) with a non-trivial strategy.

It models the following properties of real poker:

- Multiple rounds (2).
- Private and shared cards.
- Strength of a pocket can be changed significantly by the board (worse cards turns to nuts).
- Player 0 can fold before player 1 has made a single move.

The cards are A, K, Q, J, with ranks respectively from 4 to 1.

There are two rounds, in each of them there is a raise limit of one. 

In the round 0 one private card is dealt. In the round 1 one shared card is dealt.

Hand strength is defined according to the following rules:

- Ranks of a hand is the sum of ranks of the pocket and the board (e.g. pocket Q, board A: rank is 2 + 4 = 6)
- There is one exception, let's call it straight: if the pocket is J and the board is Q, 
  the rank of this hand is 8 (absolute maximum). 
- The hand with the highest rank wins the showdown.
