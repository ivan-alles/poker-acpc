The evaluators are tested by comparing the evaluation results with the the corresponding 
resulst of RefEvaluator. This requires the same format of the hand stregths (satisfied at present) and
compatible cards formats (can be always achieved).

Additionally, evaluators are tested indirectly in reference games. For example, a session of holdem
recorded on an independes source (poker site, etc.) is played with pkrserver, and the result is compared
with the original.
